        <p>I read this book because I had problem with algorithm and problem solving.</p>

<p>In this book first of all we will understand why we need Data Structures and what is the algorithm. then we will 
see what is the relationship between both of them.</p>

<p>So as I said we will familiar with some  Data Structures as I will write them below:</p>

<pre><code>- Struct
- Array
- Linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Stack
- Queue
- Priority queue
- Set
- Map
- Tree
- Graph
- Heap
</code></pre>

<p>And We will be introduced with these algorithms:</p>

<pre><code>- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Bucket sort
- Linear searching
- Binary search
- Binary search tree
- Interpolation search
- Exponential search
- Breadth first search
- Depth first search
- Floyd-Warshall
- Bellman-Ford
- Minimum spanning tree(MST)
- Prim's spanning tree algorithm
- Krushal's algorithm
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of the book author spoke about some special algorithm and approach that we can use for our applications.</p>
