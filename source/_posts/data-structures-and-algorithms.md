I read this book because I had problem with algorithm and problem solving. 

In this book first of all we will understand why we need Data Structures and what is the algorithm. then we will 
see what is the relationship between both of them.


So as I said we will familiar with some  Data Structures as I will write them below:

    - Struct
    - Array
    - Linked list
    - Doubly linked list
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Priority queue
    - Set
    - Map
    - Tree
    - Graph
    - Heap

And We will be introduced with these algorithms:

    - Bubble sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Selection sort
    - Quick sort
    - Merge sort
    - Bucket sort
    - Linear searching
    - Binary search
    - Binary search tree
    - Interpolation search
    - Exponential search
    - Breadth first search
    - Depth first search
    - Floyd-Warshall
    - Bellman-Ford
    - Minimum spanning tree(MST)
    - Prim's spanning tree algorithm
    - Krushal's algorithm

At the end of the book author spoke about some special algorithm and approach that we can use for our applications.
